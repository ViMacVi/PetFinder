# Step 1: EDA
Explore the relationship between the variables in train and the target variable (weeks until adopted). Also try to design other features we think might be important and test those.

Explore:
The relationship between features and the target vairable
The relationship between features and other features (correlation)

Once we know what type of features we have, we can start looking at models that complement them.
